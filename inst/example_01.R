    " GPT-4 is the latest and most advanced version of OpenAI's large language model that can generate natural language and code from text and image inputs. It is a successor to GPT-3 and ChatGPT, which are already impressive AI systems that can interact in conversational dialogue form and perform various tasks. But what sets GPT-4 apart from its predecessors? Here are five ways GPT-4 outsmarts ChatGPT: \n
  1. GPT-4 has better general knowledge and problem-solving abilities. \n
  GPT-4 has been trained on a larger and more diverse dataset than ChatGPT, which includes more domains, languages, and modalities. This gives GPT-4 a broader general knowledge base and allows it to handle more complex tasks with greater accuracy. For example, GPT-4 can pass a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, ChatGPT's score was around the bottom 10%. GPT-4 can also solve problems that require reasoning based on images or charts, such as suggesting recipes from ingredients or explaining data trends.\n
  2. GPT-4 is more reliable and creative.\n
  GPT-4 has been aligned using human feedback to improve its factuality, steerability, and safety. This means that GPT-4 is less likely to produce incorrect or nonsensical answers than ChatGPT, which sometimes hallucinates information or exhibits problematic social biases. GPT-4 can also admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. Moreover, GPT-4 is more creative than ChatGPT in generating content that is relevant, coherent, and engaging. "
